            <p>Thoughts of attending a local church went out the window as the day dawned beautifully sunny. We drove
                about 45 min
                south to snorkel at “Two Step,” so named because of the rocky entry. We drove a back windy and narrow
                way, filled with
                fascinating housing – some gorgeous, some more like trash dumps, found parking for $5 at an enterprising
                local’s
                property, and spent an amazing 2 hours in the water. What a lot of fish varieties! We sat and ate our
                special Canadian
                bacon sandwich on the stump of a tree just off the smooth lava shoreline.</p>

                <h1>Hints and Tips</h1>
                <h3>For Antarctica</h3>
                <p>Anyone accustomed to frequent snow or winter sports will agree that sunscreen and sunglasses will
                    protect
                    you from the
                    sun's glare as well as the reflective snow. Moisturizers can also protect your skin from chafing
                    from
                    the dry air.
                    It's cold! Be prepared with waterproof and windproof attire.
                    When taking a cruise to Antarctica, always have a solid handhold as severe wind and weather tends to
                    be
                    the greatest
                    cause of injury. Along these lines, also watch out for closing doors, loose items that may fall, and
                    try
                    to keep a solid
                    footing. In most instances, you will probably be told to remain inside your cabin if the weather is
                    severe.
                    Keep in mind that it takes days to reach a hospital from Antarctica. The best thing to do is be
                    aware of
                    your
                    surroundings.</p>
